small_dynupdater is a small tool to update your ip to two-dns, a free dynamic dns provider.
 
## Intention
* Being client at [twodns.de](http://twodns.de/ "twodns") I had of course to update my ip
* First I used a small bashscript with curl commands; but I tried to do the same with a c-programm

2.	Just set your username and password (the API-token) in the small_dynupdater.h file. 
3.	Adjust the time the program will check your IP
